# tlo-file-similarity

Command-line programs that use fuzzy hashing to compare files for similarity and
find files that are similar to each other.

## Build Requirements

* CMake
* C++17 development environment for which CMake can generate build files
* SQLite 3

## Clone, Build, and Run

Clone into tlo-file-similarity directory.

```
$ git clone --branch develop --recursive git@github.com:OOZZY/tlo-file-similarity.git
```

Build (out of source).

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -G 'Unix Makefiles' -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../tlo-file-similarity
$ make
```

Fuzzy hash all files in the samples directory and all its subdirectories. In the
samples directory, Original.txt is a text file containing six paragraphs
generated by https://loremipsum.io/. All the other text files were derived from
Original.txt through some modifications. The file names describe what
modifications were performed to derive the text file.

```
$ ./tlo-fuzzy-hash ../tlo-file-similarity/samples > hashes.txt
```

Compare hashes to find similar files.

```
$ ./tlo-find-similar-hashes hashes.txt

## CMake Options

* TLO\_FS\_COLORED\_DIAGNOSTICS
    * Tell the compiler to use colors in diagnostics (GNU/Clang only)
    * On by default
* TLO\_FS\_USE\_LIBCPP
    * Use libc++ (Clang only)
    * Off by default
* TLO\_FS\_LINK\_FS
    * Link to filesystem library of older GNU and Clang (GNU/Clang only)
    * Prior to LLVM 9, using `std::filesystem` required linker option `-lc++fs`
    * Prior to GCC 9, using `std::filesystem` required linker option
      `-lstdc++fs`
    * Off by default
* TLO\_FS\_SQLITE3\_INCLUDE\_DIRS and TLO\_FS\_SQLITE3\_LIBRARIES
    * If both are specified (non-empty strings), will search for SQLite 3
      headers in the directories specified by TLO\_FS\_SQLITE3\_INCLUDE\_DIRS
      and will link to the libraries specified by TLO\_FS\_SQLITE3\_LIBRARIES
    * Otherwise, `find_package(SQLite3 REQUIRED)` will be used instead
    * Empty strings by default
